Library Management System:
A complete system designed to manage a library’s operations, including the administration of books, the handling of loans, and the generation of statistical reports. This system allows library staff to efficiently track books, monitor availability, manage borrower information, and analyze usage statistics.

---Book Management---

-The Book Management module is responsible for organizing and maintaining all the books in the library catalog. Key features include:

1)Add New Books to a Catalog:
+Allows staff to register new books in the system with details such as title, author, genre, publication year, and other metadata.
+Ensures that all essential information about each book is stored and searchable.

2)View All Available Books:
+Provides a list of books that are currently available for borrowing.
+Users can quickly see which books are ready for loan, improving operational efficiency.

4)Search by Book Title or Author Name:
+Enables users to find specific books using keywords in the title or the author’s name.
+Helps librarians and borrowers locate books quickly, even in large catalogs.

5)Automatic and Unique ID System for Each Book:
